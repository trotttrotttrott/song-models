# song-models

Generates MIDI data for mapping song structures in sequencers. Typically, this would be done manually in MIDI sequencers with a lot of manual pointing and clicking.

So far, Logic Pro 10.2.4 is the only sequencer the output has been tested with. With Logic, use `File -> Open...` instead of `File -> Import -> MIDI File...`.
